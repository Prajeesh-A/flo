FORCE VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - FAQ FIXES NOT DEPLOYING
==============================================

This file is created to force Vercel to deploy our FAQ fixes.

Current issue: Vercel is stuck on commit 5535a03 and not deploying our FAQ fixes from commits:
- 32b9174: Add detailed debugging for FAQ API data to identify the issue  
- 5b991c9: Fix FAQ section to properly display API data instead of showing error message
- fc5d09a: Force deployment trigger

The FAQ section should show Django admin data instead of hardcoded questions.
